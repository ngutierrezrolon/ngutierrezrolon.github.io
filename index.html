        <p>i'm a data scientist with a passion for natural language processing and linguistics.
        i studied mathematics and statistics at the university of warwick
        this website is my personal portfolio, displaying some of my projects, ideas, blogs, and more!

        <!-- Project 1: Sentiment Analysis -->
        <div class="project">
            <h2>Easy Sentiment Analysis</h2>
            <p> This is a short project that attempts a sentiment analysis problem without Keras or other ML.
                The dataset includes 10,000 restaurant reviews, which are then pre-processed, cleaned and tokenized so that then
                using a downloaded pre-tagged lexicon, a calculating function can be created that counts the number of positive, neutral and negative word instances
                and finally adds up to a numerical result. This is then compared with the 1-5 rating given by the customer.

            <p> the graph shows how the calculated scores match against the empirical rating by the customer.
                Notably, only the reviews which had been given scores of 1 and 2 present negative calculated scores (with a few outlier exceptions), while all 
                reviews equal or above 3 received positive calculated scores.

            <p> The analysis features some statistical tests for correlation.
                In one instance, the Welch two sample test is used to compare the average power statistics for legendary and non-legendaries.
                Additionally, after performing a simple Anova test to check for correlations between weight and both type variables, a post-hoc
                Tukey's HSD test is performed on each of the type pairs to take notice of how type pairs interact and find which type pairs on 
                average have the highest and lowest weight. This and more statistical analysis of pokemon data on github.

            <p>this project focused on word embeddings with Spacy and explored how

            <p> Taking the japanese vectors in particular, its clear that after although the red group is not linearly
                separable in the original feature space, the pca of the vectors, that applying a radial basis function kernel
                maps the data points to a higher dimensional space where they are linearly separable. By fitting an (SVM)
                with an RBF kernel, we can clearly see in the following graph that the vectors are linearly separable.

            <h2>Blog Entry 1: Making a website</h2>
            <p>Making a website is very useful and can be very simple.
                This website is my personal portfolio and was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
                <h3>HTML</h3>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the part responsible for the structure of the content in the webpage. 
                The subsections, headers, footers, hyperlinks, and main body of text are all done in this language.
                <h3>CSS</h3>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the part responsible of all the main visuals, including fonts
                colors (in hexcode), spacing, as well as making the margins dynamic to accomodate mobile viewing.
                <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                Javascript is the most dynamic part, used to add interactivity,
                constantly updating sections, or any other advanced feature. 
                The animation in projects section is all done in javascript.
                <br>
                Making your own website is relatively simple and very satisfying work.

            <h2>Blog Entry 2: What is a "good enough" shuffle?</h2>
            <p>
                Random shuffles, randomness, card shuffling algorithms and more.
                If you like a good game of cards, whether that be (game1), game2 or game3, most card games 
                start with a shuffle. As the game starts and the people around the table look at the cards, 
                they groan and complain “who shuffled these?”. I want to talk about this conundrum of the shuffle, 
                what the meaning of the word “random” even is, and explore how its practically applied and computationally 
                replicated.
    
                There's several standard ways to shuffle.
    
                <h3>1- The Overhand Shuffle</h3>
                Not all shuffles are mixing the same amount of cards, if you think about it.
                The basic overhand shuffle is removing a sector of cards from the deck, merging the rest of the deck and then adding them back on top.
                In this case a sector of size n is simply being displaced, but that sector will retain its original order entirely.
    
                <h3>2- The Perfect Shuffle</h3>
                Most people would describe a shuffle as breaking the deck in two halves
                and then intermixing them. If the interleaving of the cards is done such that
                the two packets strictly alternate, then this is known as a perfect shuffle.
                Other names for it are Faro shuffle in USA, or Weave shuffle in UK.
                Depending on where the original top and bottom cards go, they are considered an out-shuffle or an in-shuffle.
                In an out-shuffle, the first and last card retain their positions exactly.
                In an in-shuffle, the first card will now go second, and the last card will go second-to last.
    
                k perfect in-shuffles will restore the order of an n-card deck if 
                <img src="images/equation1.png" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1em" alt="2^k congruent 1 mod n+1">.
                For a regular 52-card deck, this means 
                <img src="images/equation2.png" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1em" alt="2^52 congruent 1 mod 53">, 
                so after 52 in-shuffles, the deck is back to its original order.
    
                k perfect out-shuffles will restore the order of an n-card deck if 
                <img src="images/equation3.png" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1em" alt="2^k congruent 1 mod n-1">.
                For a 52-card deck, this means
                <img src="images/equation4.png" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1em" alt="2^8 congruent 1 mod 51">, 
                so after only 8 out-shuffles the deck is back to its original order! and for a 64-card deck, only 6 faro out-shuffles are required to restore the order.
    
                <h3>3- The Riffle</h3>
                Most people don't perform perfect shuffles, and doing these would actually be to the detriment of randomness desired for card games.
                This shuffle isn't random, it produces an entirely predictable pattern.
                This is also why Faro shuffles are common in magic tricks.
                What most people do is normally referred to as a Riffle Shuffle.
                the deck is partitioned in two, then interleaved arbitrarily. For example, groups of sizes between
                1-4 are interleaved from each half of the deck.
                A mathematically precise definition exists credited to Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds. The Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model assigns probabilities to each permutation.
                For example, when partitioning the deck, the probability of selecting one group of k cards and one of n-k cards is 
                <img src="images/equation5.png" loading="lazy" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 1em" alt="n choose k /2^n">

                Bayer and Diaconis's paper titled <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/bayer92.pdf"> Trailing the Dovetail Shuffle to its Lair</a> then analysed this model, and showed that the total variation distance from uniform distribution show 
                a distinctive spike from 5, where the total variation distance was still close to 1, to 7 where this measure was of 0.331. 
                This mathematical result suggests 7 riffle shuffles to produce a sufficiently random pattern, such that this combination might not have been seen ever before.
