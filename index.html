        <h2>Blog Entry 1: Making a website</h2>
        <p>Making a website is very useful and can be very simple.
            This website is my personal portfolio and was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the part responsible for the structure of the content in the webpage. 
            The subsections, headers, footers, hyperlinks, and main body of text are all done in this language.
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the part responsible of all the main visuals, including fonts
            colors (in hexcode), spacing, etc.
            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            Javascript is the most dynamic part, used to add interactivity,
            constantly updating sections, or any other advanced feature.
            <br>
            Day 1:
            Set up of the HTML structure, Header, Button, Main section, non main sections, footer.
            set up CSS for a basic look with a matching color palette.
            compiled list of chengyu in csv
            javascript for daily chengyu and button functionalities.
            Day 2:
            started with fixing main page and non-main page sectioning 
            also fixing scroll feature.
            added more content to project section, added contact form (and php file pending)
            changed color palette, fonts and 
            Day 3:
            fixed active-link functions, worked on text for project and blog essays.

        <h2>Blog Entry 2: What is a "good enough" shuffle?</h2>
        <p>
            Random shuffles, randomness, card shuffling algorithms and more.
            If you like a good game of cards, whether that be (game1), game2 or game3, most card games 
            start with a shuffle. As the game starts and the people around the table look at the cards, 
            they groan and complain “who shuffled these?”. I want to talk about this conundrum of the shuffle, 
            what the meaning of the word “random” even is, and explore how its practically applied and computationally 
            replicated.
            <h3>1- The Shuffle</h3>

            There's several standard ways to shuffle.
            Casino shuffle.
            Overhand shuffle.
            Not all shuffles are mixing the same amount of cards, if you think about it.
            The basic overhand shuffle is removing a sector of cards from the deck, merging the rest of the deck and then adding them back on top.
            In this case a sector of size n is simply being displaced, but that sector will retain its original order entirely.
            How many “shuffles” exist? 52!
